Why This Elevator is bad
This elevators user interface is design is very confusing as the interior has two doors within the elevator. A front and a read door however it is impossible to determine which side is which as its s unmarked. There are also buttons labeled LLF and LLR with unclear instructions. Also, 1F and 1R should be level to show that they’re on the same floor rather than staggered. Additionally, the separated door opening interface is a bit confusing, takes an inadequate amount of time to tell which button controls which side and could easily be solved with two buttons rather than four. Outside the up and down buttons are not labeled. 

Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
The most commonly used features of the elevator are the interface specific buttons that control which floor the elevator is guided to along with the door closing button. A little less frequently the door opening button is used to hold the door for someone coming toward the elevator but it’s not necessary in every use. Other attributes such as the alarm and phone are used in emergency situations and are not near as utilized. The interface in this elevator is easy to use in an emergency and even includes brail for visually impaired individuals however the more commonly used interfaces such as the floor and door controls are confusing in this interface.

Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?
A common sequence of actions for a user interaction with an elevator may be for the user to walk up and analyze the exterior interface (With a destination floor in mind) and select the direction they intend to travel in the elevator (Up or down). They then enter the elevator upon it reaching their floor and then analyze the interior interface. They search for the number that correlates to the desired floor and press what appears to be the most likely input to tell the elevator to go to that floor. They then will attempt to close the elevator with another button or wait for the elevator to close on its own.

How does the elevator support the user figure out how to make it work?
The elevator may assist the user in making the operation process easier by labeling the buttons clearly or including brail for the blind people. The labeling must clearly reflect the button it’s being attributed too so the user know which controls do what. This can also be insinuated by the position of the buttons in relation to the others or the labeling so all factors must be considered when aiding a new user in understanding the operation of the elevator.

How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
The elevator I located had a display on the top of the elevator that told the occupants the current floor of the elevator. The buttons also illuminated after touching them to indicate to the user that they’re heading to that floor or in queue to eventually head to the desired floor.

What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
Some common mistakes that can be made with the current design include pressing the wrong direction upon entering the elevator as the exterior interface is not clearly labeled. Also, the user may click on the wrong door (Front or back) if they don’t have the prior knowledge of which side is which.
